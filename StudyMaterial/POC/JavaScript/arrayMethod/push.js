// Javascript Array.push() Method
// Adding Element at the end of an Array. As arrays in JavaScript
//  are mutable objects, we can easily add or remove elements from 
//  the Array. And it dynamically changes as
//  we modify the elements from the array. 

let number_arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
let string_arr = ["piyush", "gourav", "smruti", "ritu"];
 
// push()
// number_arr contains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
number_arr.push(60);
